## Materials for Dayton TechFest

[Dayton TechFest](http://www.ascdayton.org/TechFest/) is an annual event where professional and hobby technical groups create participative
exhibits that interest local youth in science and technology.  DLUG traditionally uses tables at TechFest
to introduce kids and their parents to open source.

We use this repo to organize our TechFest effort.
